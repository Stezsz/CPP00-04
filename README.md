# ðŸ§  C++ Modules â€“ 42 School Projects (CPP00â€“CPP04)

These modules are part of the C++ introduction series at 42 School, focused on progressively teaching Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), C++ syntax, and memory management concepts.

---

## CPP00 â€“ Basics of C++

**Main Topics:**
- Namespaces
- std::cout, std::cin
- File streams
- Basic class and instance creation
- Member functions and attributes
- Constructors and destructors

**Goals:**
- Get comfortable with basic C++ syntax
- Understand class structure and object instantiation
- Learn how streams work in C++

> âœ… **Final Grade: /100**

## CPP01 â€“ Memory and References

**Main Topics:**
- Stack vs Heap
- Pointers and references
- Dynamic memory allocation (`new`, `delete`)
- Copy constructors and assignment operators

**Goals:**
- Understand memory handling in C++
- Learn the difference between shallow and deep copies
- Practice managing object lifetimes manually

> âœ… **Final Grade: /100**

## CPP02 â€“ Ad-hoc Canonical Classes

**Main Topics:**
- Orthodox Canonical Form (default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor)
- Operator overloading
- Encapsulation best practices

**Goals:**
- Implement classes the "C++ way"
- Ensure safe copying and assigning of objects
- Improve understanding of class design and maintenance

> âœ… **Final Grade: /100**

## CPP03 â€“ Inheritance and Polymorphism

**Main Topics:**
- Inheritance (base and derived classes)
- Virtual functions
- Polymorphism
- Abstract classes and interfaces

**Goals:**
- Leverage inheritance to reuse code and extend behavior
- Use virtual functions for dynamic dispatch
- Design flexible and scalable class hierarchies

> âœ… **Final Grade: /100**

## CPP04 â€“ Deep Dive into Polymorphism

**Main Topics:**
- Interfaces with pure virtual functions
- Deep copying in inheritance
- Dynamic allocation of derived types
- Proper use of destructors in inheritance (virtual destructors)

**Goals:**
- Master polymorphism and interface-based design
- Handle object slicing and proper memory management
- Understand the importance of virtual destructors
